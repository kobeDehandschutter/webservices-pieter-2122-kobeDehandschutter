        info: 'Anthony Edward Tony Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers, and the former CEO of Stark Industries. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, Stark was one of the world\'s most powerful men following the deaths of his parents and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles. With his life on the line, Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use against terrorists, as well as Obadiah Stane who turned against Stark. Following his fight against Stane, Stark publicly revealed himself as Iron Man.\r\nFresh off from defeating enemies all over the world, Stark found himself dying due to his own Arc Reactor poisoning his body, all while he was challenged by Ivan Vanko who attempted to destroy his legacy. After the Stark Expo incident, Stark reluctantly agreed to serve as a consultant for S.H.I.E.L.D. where he used his position to upgrade their technology while he began a relationship with Pepper Potts. With the world yet again being threatened, Stark joined the Avengers and helped defeat the Chitauri and Loki. Due to the battle, he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, leading him to create the Iron Legion to safeguard the world and help him retire.\r\nThe 2012 Mandarin terrorist attacks forced Stark to come out of retirement to protect his country, inadvertently putting his loved ones at risk and leaving him defenseless when his home was destroyed. Stark continued his mission, finding Aldrich Killian as the mastermind of the attacks. Eventually, Stark defeated Killian, and was prompted to destroy all of his armors with the Clean Slate Protocol after almost losing Potts. However, when the Avengers were officially demobilized due to the War on HYDRA, Stark built more armors and resumed his role as Iron Man, aiding them in the capture of Baron Strucker and acquiring Loki\'s Scepter.\r\nOnce the threat of HYDRA had been ended, at last, Stark, influenced by Scarlet Witch\'s visions, built Ultron with the help of Bruce Banner as a new peacekeeping A.I. to protect the world and allow the Avengers to retire. However, Ultron believed that humanity threatened the world and thus, according to his program, decided to extinguish humanity. Through the work of the Avengers, Ultron was defeated, however, not without massive civilian cost and many lives being lost during which Sokovia was elevated into the sky.\r\nAfter the Ultron Offensive, Stark retired from active duty, still haunted by his role in the chaos the A.I. created. The guilt of creating Ultron and causing so much destruction and loss of life eventually convinced Stark to support the Sokovia Accords. Stark was forced to lead a manhunt for his ally Captain America when the latter began protecting the fugitive Winter Soldier, igniting the Avengers Civil War. The end result left the Avengers in complete disarray, especially after Stark learned of the Winter Soldier\'s role in his parents\' deaths. Afterwards, Stark returned to New York to mentor and guide Spider-Man into becoming a better hero than he ever was, also becoming engaged with Potts in the process.\r\nIn 2018, when Thanos and the Black Order invaded Earth in their conquest to acquire the six Infinity Stones, Stark, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man convened to battle Thanos on Titan with the help of the Guardians of the Galaxy. When Stark was held at Thanos\' mercy, Doctor Strange surrendered the Time Stone for Stark\'s life. After the Snap, Stark and Nebula remained the sole survivors on Titan. Stark and Nebula used the Benatar to escape Titan, but were stranded in space as the ship was damaged. They were rescued by Captain Marvel, who brought them back to Earth.\r\nIn the five years after the Snap, Stark chose to retire from being Iron Man, marrying Potts and having a daughter, Morgan. When Stark devised a method to safely travel through time and space, he rejoined the Avengers in their mission to acquire the six Infinity Stones from the past in order to resurrect those killed by the Snap, and traveled back in time to retrieve the Scepter and regain the Tesseract. During the Battle of Earth, Stark sacrificed himself to eliminate an alternate version of Thanos and his army, who traveled through time to collect their Infinity Stones, saving the universe from decimation and leaving behind a legacy as one of Earth\'s most revered superheroes.',

        info: 'Doctor Robert Bruce Banner, M.D., Ph.D., is a renowned scientist and a founding member of the Avengers. Highly respected for his work in Biochemistry, Nuclear Physics, and Gamma Radiation, Banner was commissioned by Thaddeus Ross to recreate the Super Soldier Serum that created Captain America. However, Ross elected not to inform Banner what he was creating. During the experiment, Banner was exposed to dangerous levels of gamma radiation (rather than vita radiation). As a result, the mild-mannered scientist found that when angered, provoked, or excited, his body and brain would transform into a huge, rage-fueled, primitive-minded creature known as Hulk.\r\n\r\nFor five years, Banner remained on the run from the United States Army, and at one point attempted suicide. When the attempt failed, he chose to live a discreet life in South America while also communicating with Samuel Sterns to cure himself. However, when General Ross sent a team led by Emil Blonsky to apprehend Banner, Banner was forced to return to New York City. He recruited the help of Betty Ross and Sterns to cure him of his affliction, but was captured shortly thereafter at Grayburn College. Blonsky, who had received a variant of the Super Soldier Serum, was administered Banner\'s gamma-irradiated blood, transforming him into the Abomination. This new threat forced Ross to allow Banner to turn into Hulk and battle Blonsky, before allowing Banner to escape.\r\n\r\nAfter the Asgardian Loki attacked S.H.I.E.L.D., Banner was personally recruited by Natasha Romanoff into the Avengers Initiative, and was tasked with Tony Stark to track down the Tesseract. Despite losing control and attacking the Avengers during the Attack on the Helicarrier, Banner joined the Avengers during the Battle of New York, assisting them in defeating Loki and his Chitauri army, averting the Chitauri Invasion.\r\n\r\nBanner had become good friends with Stark and relocated to Avengers Tower, free to live his life without apprehension. In the wake of the HYDRA Uprising, the Avengers regrouped once more to battle the ever-growing threat of HYDRA, successfully capturing Baron Strucker. With the Scepter in their custody, Banner assisted Stark with creating Ultron, an artificial intelligence peacekeeping program. Ultron, programmed to protect Earth at all costs, deemed humanity and the Avengers as peace\'s greatest threat and focused on annihilating them. Banner and Stark created Vision as a deterrent to Ultron, and participated in the Battle of Sokovia to dismantle Ultron\'s threat. Banner went AWOL, and instead commandeered a Quinjet and left Earth.\r\n\r\nDuring interstellar travel, Banner came across a wormhole that caused him to crash on Sakaar. There, the stressful environment prevented him from returning to his human form, causing him to remain in Hulk form for two years. Hulk became a gladiator for Grandmaster and was soon revered as a beloved champion, choosing to turn his back on Earth and enjoy the life of an admired warrior. However, when Thor arrived on the planet, Hulk fought against his old friend in the arena. In the wake of their fight, Thor informed Hulk that Asgard was under threat due to Hela\'s return. Eventually, Banner reemerges, agreeing to help Thor in his plight. He transforms back into Hulk and aids the Asgardians in their fight, defeating Fenris and allowing the Asgardians to board the Statesman vessel. Then, as Ragnarök was unleashed, Banner joined them on their voyage to Earth.\r\n\r\nEn route to Earth, the Statesman was attacked by the Black Order, and the Asgardians quickly massacred. Banner fought their leader Thanos, who quickly defeated him before Heimdall was transported back to Earth, where he warned Doctor Strange, Iron Man, and later Captain America of Thanos\' arrival. Finding himself no longer able to transform into Hulk, Banner operated a Hulkbuster armor to aid the Avengers in the Battle of Wakanda. Although Banner and his allies managed to kill off Thanos\' forces, Thanos personally arrived in Wakanda to retrieve the Mind Stone. He effortlessly subdued Banner and the other heroes and completed the Infinity Gauntlet, wiping out half of the universe\'s population. Banner was one of the survivors.\r\n\r\nAfter the Snap, Banner merged his consciousness and Hulk into one being, which combined Hulk\'s raw strength and physique with Banner\'s mind and intelligence, becoming an adored celebrity. In 2023, he rejoined the Avengers to help them use Pym Particles and the Quantum Realm to travel through time. After traveling back to the Battle of New York in 2012, Banner successfully acquired the Time Stone and returned to the present. Using the Nano Gauntlet, Banner elected to use the Stones to initiate the Blip, resurrecting all the lives claimed by the Snap. In the aftermath of the Battle of Earth, he helped Captain America return the stones to their respective timelines.\r\n\r\nEventually, Banner returned back to human form, and began investigating the origin of the mystical Ten Rings after Shang-Chi harnessed them in the Battle of Ta Lo.',

        info: 'Thor Odinson is the Asgardian God of Thunder, the former king of Asgard and New Asgard, and a founding member of the Avengers. When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior reignited a conflict between Asgard and Jotunheim, Thor was denied the right to become king, stripped of his power, and banished to Earth by Odin. While exiled on Earth, Thor learned humility, finding love with Jane Foster, and helped save his new friends from the Destroyer sent by Loki. Due to his selfless act of sacrifice, Thor redeemed himself in his father\'s eyes and was granted his power once more, which he then used to defeat Loki\'s schemes of genocide.\r\n\r\nUpon being welcomed back to Asgard as a hero, Thor was forced to return to Earth in order to retrieve Loki after he had survived a fall through a black hole and had begun his attempt at world domination, having taken possession of the Tesseract. Thor joined the Avengers under the guidance of S.H.I.E.L.D. and stood with them to stop the schemes of his own adopted brother, eventually following the newly formed team as they battled against Loki\'s army of the Chitauri during the Battle of New York until Loki was eventually defeated by the Avengers, captured and returned onto Asgard to await justice for his crimes against Earth.\r\n\r\nThor returned to Asgard having defeated his brother\'s schemes, as he then helped the Asgardian Armies restore peace across all of the Nine Realms during the War of the Nine Realms. However, the peace proved to be short-lived as Thor then fought the Dark Elves during the Second Dark Elf Conflict as they had attempted to plunge the Nine Realms into eternal darkness. During these events, Thor was reunited with Jane Foster who had become host to the Aether and a target of the Dark Elves, with Thor being forced to free Loki from imprisonment for his aid. Eventually, the Aether was removed from Foster\'s body and Loki seemingly sacrificed Thor from Kurse, leading to the Dark Elves and Malekith\'s defeat. Thor renounced his claim to the throne and left Asgard for Earth so he could stay with Foster.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay on Earth, Thor helped the Avengers once again, this time in their attempts to locate Loki\'s Scepter. This also led to him joining the fight against HYDRA. Following HYDRA\'s defeat and the capture of Baron Strucker, the team had to stop the newly created Ultron, a rogue invention inadvertently created by Tony Stark which had threatened to wipe out all of humanity and replace it with its own Ultron Sentries. Once Ultron had been defeated, Thor promised his allies that he would return and went back to Asgard to investigate the visions he saw when being manipulated by Wanda Maximoff of the Infinity Stones. In his investigations, Thor also discovered that Loki was still alive and had usurped Odin\'s royal throne during Thor\'s absence.\r\n\r\nTo aid in both pursuing his brother and finding his father to return peace to Asgard, Thor sought help from Doctor Strange. However, Thor was just too late to save his own father from death. Shortly afterwards, Thor met Hela, the Goddess of Death and his sister. In the wake of his first encounter with Hela, Thor\'s hammer Mjølnir was destroyed and he was banished to Sakaar, where he was forced to compete in the Contest of Champions. After a reunion and subsequent fight with Hulk, the pair allied with the rogue Valkyrie in order to save Asgard and escape Sakaar. After battling with Hela and losing an eye to her, Thor then had Loki unleash Ragnarök and destroy Asgard, killing Hela in the process, although he escaped with the remaining Asgardians. Declaring that Asgard was all its people and not a place, Thor accepted his newfound position as king and decided to relocate the Asgardians on Earth.\r\n\r\nAs they were en route to Earth, their ship was attacked by Thanos and the Black Order, who sought the Tesseract which Loki took from Asgard\'s vault at the last moment. Thor witnessed Thanos take the stone and murder his brother before he was flung from the ship and left for dead. He was rescued by the Guardians of the Galaxy and had teamed up with Rocket Raccoon and Groot to travel to Nidavellir. With the help of Eitri, Thor crafted Stormbreaker and aided the nation of Wakanda and the Avengers in defeating the Outriders and confronting Thanos. However, Thor squandered his chance to kill Thanos with his new weapon and Thanos activated the completed Infinity Gauntlet and erased half the universe\'s population from existence before he escaped. After the Avengers were joined by Captain Marvel, the team traveled to the Garden, where Thor and the Avengers ambushed and interrogated Thanos, discovering that the Titan destroyed the Stones, ensuring that a reversal of his actions was now impossible. Enraged, Thor beheaded Thanos using Stormbreaker and left the planet.\r\n\r\nFollowing Thanos\' death, Thor left the Avengers and relocated to Tønsberg, Norway, where he and the surviving Asgardians resettled, renaming the town New Asgard. Five years later, Hulk and Rocket traveled to New Asgard to convince the now-overweight and depressed Thor to rejoin the team after discovering how to travel through time. Thor joined the Avengers on their Time Heist and participated in the Battle of Earth, where he fought an alternate timeline Thanos alongside Captain America and Iron Man, the latter sacrificing his life to eliminate Thanos and his armies. After attending Stark\'s funeral, Thor decided to join the Guardians of the Galaxy, proclaiming Valkyrie to succeed him as king of the Asgardians.',

        info: 'Captain Steven Grant Steve Rogers is a World War II veteran, a founding member of the Avengers, and Earth\'s first known superhero. Rogers grew up suffering from numerous health problems, and upon America\'s entry into World War II, he was rejected from serving in the United States Army despite several attempts to enlist. Rogers ultimately volunteered for Project Rebirth, where he was the only recipient of the Super Soldier Serum developed by Abraham Erskine under the Strategic Scientific Reserve. The serum greatly enhanced Rogers\' physical abilities to superhuman levels. After Erskine\'s assassination and being doubted by SSR head director Chester Phillips, Rogers was relegated to performing in war bond campaigns, where he posed as a patriotic mascot under the moniker of Captain America.\r\n\r\nIn 1943, Rogers rejoined the SSR after single-handedly liberating Allied prisoners from a HYDRA base, after which he began leading his team of Howling Commandos in many operations against HYDRA. His World War II exploits made Rogers a living legend, and during this time he also formed a close relationship with SSR agent Peggy Carter. Rogers ultimately helped the Allies win the war and defeat HYDRA\'s leader Red Skull, but crashed into the Arctic during his final mission to stop a plane carrying bombs bound for the United States. Rogers then spent sixty-six years unconscious and frozen in ice under a state of suspended animation, before he was eventually found by S.H.I.E.L.D. in the early 21st century.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, Rogers found himself alone in a modern world that he hardly recognized, with no idea what to do with his life. Following Loki\'s theft of the Tesseract from S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury enlisted Rogers\' help in retrieving the Tesseract and stopping Loki from destroying the world. Joining the Avengers, Rogers played a key role in the Battle of New York, successfully stopping the invasion, capturing Loki, and reacquiring the Tesseract.\r\n\r\nRogers then joined S.H.I.E.L.D. as a counter-terrorist operative. While uncovering a conspiracy inside the organization, he encountered the Winter Soldier, and discovered that HYDRA had infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. intending to use Project Insight as a way to bring about a despotic new world order. He then learned that Winter Soldier was his best friend Bucky Barnes, who he thought was killed in action during World War II, but had since been physically enhanced and brainwashed by HYDRA. Alongside Black Widow, Maria Hill and Falcon, Rogers then ended the HYDRA Uprising at the Battle at the Triskelion.\r\n\r\nRogers and the Avengers reassembled and embarked in an all-out war against HYDRA, recapturing the Scepter and capturing Baron Strucker. After Ultron, the new peacekeeping artificial intelligence program designed by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, had went rogue, Rogers and the Avengers rallied to stop it from exterminating humanity. Ultron was ultimately defeated during the Battle of Sokovia, after which several of the original Avengers departed, leaving Rogers and Romanoff to lead and train the new Avengers team.\r\n\r\nThe new Avengers conducted several international missions, but failed to avert a catastrophic incident while on assignment to capture Crossbones in Nigeria. The United Nations used the disaster to ratify the Sokovia Accords, but Rogers saw their draconian nature and refused to sign, resulting in a rift between himself and Avengers co-leader Tony Stark. After the Accords ratification was bombed, with Bucky Barnes resurfacing as the primary suspect, Rogers and his anti-accord allies became fugitives of the law while assisting in his escape. Upon learning Helmut Zemo was the true mastermind, Rogers fought against Stark and his pro-accord allies before confronting Zemo in Siberia. When Zemo revealed Barnes\' role in the Assassination of Howard and Maria Stark, Rogers came to Barnes\' defense once an enraged Stark attacked him. They engaged in a fierce fight with Stark and emerged the victor, but with the Avengers deeply divided. Rogers eventually rescued some of his anti-accord associates from the Raft, and had Barnes sent to Wakanda to be cured of his brainwashing.\r\n\r\nRogers, Black Widow, Falcon, and Scarlet Witch continued to be fugitives from the law, but when Thanos and his Black Order attacked Earth seeking the final Infinity Stones, Rogers emerged from hiding in order to protect Vision. Rogers had Vision brought to Wakanda, and came to the country\'s defense when it was attacked by the Order an onslaught of Outriders. Captain America failed to stop Thanos from taking the Mind Stone and initiating the Snap, wherein half the universe\'s population was wiped. Rogers survived, and journeyed through space to Planet 0259-S, where the Avengers killed Thanos.\r\n\r\nFive years after the Snap, Rogers and his fellow Avengers eventually found a way to safely travel through time, returning to various points in the past to amass all six Infinity Stones, making amends with Tony Stark in the process. The stones were used to initiate the Blip, and he resumed the mantle of Captain America once more to participate in the Battle of Earth, where he discovered he was deemed worthy of Mjølnir, wielding it in combat against Thanos and his army from an alternate timeline. After Stark sacrificed his life to wipe out Thanos and his armies, Rogers volunteered to return the stones to their respective timelines. He opted to return and remain in the 1940s, where he married Peggy Carter. Rogers grew old and reunited with his friends in the present, entrusting Sam Wilson with his mantle and shield. Rogers entered retirement, with his current whereabouts unknown to the general public.',

        info: 'Scott Edward Harris Lang is a former convicted thief who was struggling to pay child support to his estranged wife for visitation rights to his daughter, Cassie Lang. With the promise of money, he was convinced by Hank Pym to take on the mantle of Ant-Man: a superhero with an advanced suit designed to shrink its wearer to a tiny size while increasing one\'s toughness, agility, and physical strength. Trained under both Pym and his daughter Hope van Dyne, Ant-Man was to help foil Pym\'s former protege Darren Cross, who was intending to sell his Yellowjacket Suit design and his copy of the Pym Particles formula to HYDRA and the Ten Rings. However, their plan was discovered by Cross, culminating in a final fight between Yellowjacket and Ant-Man. To defeat Yellowjacket, Ant-Man had to shrink small enough to enter Yellowjacket\'s suit and destroy it, sending Ant-Man to the Quantum Realm, but Ant-Man was able to escape. Ant-Man\'s heroism helped restore his relationship with Cassie and his ex-wife, as well as find a new romantic one with van Dyne. Lang soon learned that the Avengers were seeking to recruit him.\r\n\r\nAgainst Pym and van Dyne\'s wishes, Ant-Man joined Captain America\'s side during the Avengers Civil War, having been recommended by the Falcon following their previous encounter at the Avengers Compound, and being informed of Helmut Zemo\'s plan to awaken the Winter Soldiers. Ant-Man fought against Iron Man and his allies, demonstrating his suit\'s new ability to enlarge his body to a gigantic size, and allowing Captain America and Winter Soldier to escape and find Zemo. Ant-Man and several of his new allies were then arrested by Thaddeus Ross, who had them imprisoned in the Raft for breaking the Sokovia Accords. When Captain America arrived to free them, Ant-Man escaped, but later made a deal with the FBI to be put under house arrest so that he could still spend time with his family.\r\n\r\nThree days before Lang could finish his sentence, he had a strange vision of Janet van Dyne, who had remained trapped inside the Quantum Realm, and with whom Lang became psychically entangled with while he was there. This resulted in Lang being kidnapped by Pym and Hope van Dyne, who had built a Quantum Tunnel machine and intended to use it and Ant-Man to rescue Janet. These plans went awry when Ant-Man and Wasp were confronted by both Ghost and Sonny Burch, who wanted to steal the Quantum Tunnel machine for their own reasons. Ant-Man, Wasp, and Pym eventually succeeded in rescuing Janet from the Quantum Realm, and Ant-Man was able to return home to finish his house arrest, narrowly avoiding an extended prison sentence.\r\n\r\nHowever, during a trip to the Quantum Realm to gather quantum particles for Ghost, Ant-Man became trapped as Pym\'s entire family was turned to dust by Thanos following the Snap, along with half of all life in the universe. Ant-Man was unable to escape until 2023, where he regrouped with the Avengers and suggested that they use the Quantum Realm as a means of time travel to the past. Ant-Man then officially joined the Avengers and participated in the Time Heist, where they successfully managed to acquire the six Infinity Stones from alternate pasts and brought them to their timeline, using the Stones to resurrect the victims of Thanos\' Snap. However, an alternate Thanos had managed to follow the Avengers through time, and Ant-Man fought in the resulting Battle of Earth. Thanos and his army were eventually destroyed, after which Lang celebrated the victory with van Dyne and Cassie, and attended Tony Stark\'s funeral.',

        info: 'Natalia Alianovna Natasha Romanoff (Russian: Наталья Альяновна Наташа Романов) was one of the most talented spies and assassins in the entire world and a founding member of the Avengers. As a child, she was indoctrinated into the Red Room by General Dreykov, and briefly lived as the surrogate daughter of Alexei Shostakov and Melina Vostokoff while they were undercover in the United States of America. After the Destruction of the North Institute, she underwent extensive psychological conditioning, before graduating from the Red Room as a Widow. Working as an operative for the KGB, she was targeted by S.H.I.E.L.D., before given the chance to ultimately defect to the organization by Clint Barton by assassinating Dreykov. Romanoff succeeded, although having to use his daughter Antonia Dreykov\'s life as collateral damage would haunt her for the rest of her life.\r\n\r\nHaving extensive mastery in martial arts and armed with her Widow\'s Bite, Romanoff became one of S.H.I.E.L.D.\'s most efficient agents, using the title given by her former organization as her codename, Black Widow. During one mission, she was sent undercover into Stark Industries as Natalie Rushman to watch Tony Stark due to the fear that he was dying. During this mission, Romanoff assisted Stark with defeating Ivan Vanko\'s terrorist plots against him.\r\n\r\nWhen Loki declared war on the Earth, Black Widow was recruited into the Avengers after Hawkeye had just been enthralled by Loki. Romanoff assisted in recruiting Stark and Bruce Banner into the team while they tracked down and attempted to capture Loki, eventually saving Barton from his grasp. Once Loki\'s entire plan had been uncovered, Romanoff joined the team during the Battle of New York and was instrumental in destroying the portal over the city which had been created by the Tesseract, effectively ending the entire invasion while Loki was defeated and deported back to his homeworld by his brother Thor.\r\n\r\nIn the wake of the Avengers successfully defeating Loki, Romanoff continued her work with S.H.I.E.L.D., this time working with Captain America. While working together, Romanoff and Rogers uncovered a conspiracy following an assassination attempt on Nick Fury, which had eventually led to them discovering that HYDRA had been infiltrating their entire organization since its foundation. Despite the efforts of the Winter Soldier to stop them, Romanoff helped expose Alexander Pierce\'s evil schemes to the world, which also resulted in all of her own morally dubious history being revealed. As a result, Romanoff was forced into dropping off the grid again and began rebuilding her cover.\r\n\r\nRomanoff eventually rejoined the Avengers, working to bring down various HYDRA cells across the world and assisting in the capture of Baron Strucker. However, before she could form a romantic relationship with Banner, the rogue artificial intelligence Ultron was created by him and Stark, forcing Romanoff and the rest of their team to join together and defeat him. Despite being captured, Romanoff was able to inform the team of Ultron\'s location on Sokovia, resulting in a final battle in which the Avengers had defeated Ultron once and for all, though Banner fled into self-exile. Along with Captain America, Black Widow remained a member while forming the second incarnation of the team.\r\n\r\nAs many of the world governments demanded the Avengers to sign the Sokovia Accords in the wake of their recent battles, Romanoff agreed to their terms and signed the Accords. She later joined Iron Man in a fight against Captain America due to his disagreements with the Accords and his criminal activities with the Winter Soldier who Rogers was attempting to protect. As the two Avengers\' factions fought against each other, Romanoff betrayed Iron Man\'s team to assist Captain America in finding the one incriminating the Winter Soldier, inherently violating the Sokovia Accords.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the fugitive Romanoff worked with Rick Mason to escape the government for aiding Rogers. In the process, Romanoff intercepted messages from her former surrogate sister Yelena Belova about the Red Room\'s resurgence. In possession of the Red Dust, Romanoff and Belova were relentlessly pursued by Taskmaster, who worked for Dreykov, who was believed to have been killed. Reuniting with her surrogate parents, they worked together to bring down the Red Room once and for all. Upon learning Taskmaster was actually Antonia, who had survived all these years but was mind-controlled by Dreykov, Romanoff freed her from Dreykov\'s enthrallment, and put an end to Dreykov\'s plans for world domination. Romanoff soon joined Rogers in freeing the incarcerated Avengers.\r\n\r\nWith the Avengers broken up, Romanoff, Rogers and Wilson went on the run for two years as international fugitives, working alone to stop terrorist cells in Syria. When the threat of Thanos approached Earth, Romanoff, Rogers, and Wilson protected Vision, who had the Mind Stone, which Thanos was after. They later defended Wakanda from the attack, but were ultimately defeated when Thanos destroyed half of all life with the Infinity Gauntlet, where Romanoff emerged as one of the survivors. Romanoff was part of the Ambush on Thanos in an effort to retrieve the Infinity Stones and undo the Titan\'s snap, with no success.\r\n\r\nFive years later, Romanoff led the Avengers alongside Captain America, now formed by Okoye, Rocket Raccoon, Nebula, War Machine, and Captain Marvel. With an opportunity to undo the Snap presented by Ant-Man, the remaining Avengers split up into teams to retrieve all Infinity Stones from several alternate timelines in the Time Heist. Sent to retrieve the Soul Stone on Vormir with Barton, Romanoff, against Barton\'s insistence, willingly jumped off the Vormir mountains into the abyss below, sacrificing herself in the process in order to obtain the Soul Stone for the Avengers.',

Known for his use of the bow and arrow as his primary weapon and an extremely keen eyesight and accuracy that earned him the codename Hawkeye, Barton had become one of the best S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, responsible for the recruitment of Black Widow, whom he developed a strong friendship with. Assigned by Nick Fury into watching over the Tesseract, he was brainwashed by Loki and used as his pawn in his attempt to become king of Midgard. However, following their Attack on the Helicarrier, he was freed from Loki\'s mental controls by Black Widow and joined the Avengers to fight against Loki and the Chitauri army in the battle of New York, ending Loki\'s invasion, before Hawkeye had returned to his work at a S.H.I.E.L.D..\r\n\r\nHawkeye continued to work with S.H.I.E.L.D. until its collapse following the HYDRA Uprising, he and the Avengers worked to bring down the remnants of HYDRA, eventually capturing Baron Strucker and ending the organization\'s threat to the world. However, Hawkeye was pulled back into their fight as Tony Stark had inadvertently used HYDRA as well as some Chitauri technology to create Ultron. As Ultron tried to destroy their world, he allied himself with Pietro and Wanda Maximoff and Barton focused much of his efforts in convincing them to change sides while keeping all the Avengers safe by bringing them into his family home. During the final battle of Sokovia, Hawkeye\'s life was saved by Quicksilver\'s sacrifice, resulting in Barton retiring.\r\n\r\nDespite living happily within retirement for a brief time, Barton was recruited by Captain America to help him during his fight against these newly produced Sokovia Accords, which forced Rogers to protect his friend Bucky Barnes from being arrested for a crime that he did not commit.

Despite putting up a good fight, Hawkeye and most of their team were eventually defeated and imprisoned at the Raft under the order from Thaddeus Ross, only to be freed by Rogers. Barton returned back to retirement and, after striking his deal with Ross, was then placed under his house arrest.\r\n\r\nIn the wake of the Snap, Barton lost his family and went onto a grief-fuelled rampage against criminals for five years as a vigilante known as the Ronin. Having been found by Black Widow, Barton was then convinced to return to the Avengers in attempt to reverse the Snap. Hawkeye joined the team in enacting the Time Heist in order to obtain the Infinity Stones, during which he witnessed Romanoff sacrifice her life so Hawkeye could obtain the Soul Stone. However, as the Avengers had succeeded in their goal, they were ambushed by Thanos, with Hawkeye being ordered to ensure Thanos could not get the Nano Gauntlet. Eventually, Thanos and his entire army were defeated, as Stark had sacrificed his life, allowing Barton to then return home with his beloved family, while he still mourned Romanoff\'s death.\r\n\r\nIn 2024, Barton wanted to spend Christmas with his family, but was drawn into dealing with the Tracksuit Mafia after Kate Bishop stole and donned the Ronin suit, bringing with it the demons of Barton\'s past. Barton reluctantly took on Kate as his protégé, as the pair navigated the increasing complication of the conspiracy. The pair had a series of clashes with the Tracksuits and their leader Maya Lopez, who wanted revenge on the Ronin. Barton was also hunted by Yelena Belova, who believed that he killed Romanoff, as well as helping Bishop uncover her mother\'s involvement with Kingpin. Ultimately, Hawkeye had held back fighting Belova as he convinced her that her sister\'s sacrifice was her choice, that they could never have stopped. Ending the Ronin conflict, he made it home to his family, gaining a new partner in Bishop.',

Originally being a brilliant but arrogant neurosurgeon, Strange got into a car accident which resulted with his hands becoming crippled. Once Western medicine failed him, Strange embarked on a journey to Kamar-Taj, where he was trained by the Ancient One in the ways of Magic and the Multiverse. Although he focused on healing his hands, Strange was drawn into a conflict with Kaecilius and the Zealots, who were working for Dormammu and had sought to merge Earth with the Dark Dimension to find an eternal life. Following the demise of the Ancient One and the defeat of Kaecilius, Strange then became the new protector for the Sanctum Sanctorum, seeking to defend the Earth from other inter-dimensional threats.\r\n\r\nFrom his new position, Strange aided Thor in locating Odin, before he learned of Thanos\' attempts to gain all of the Infinity Stones and cause a universal genocide. Since Strange was the protector of the Time Stone, he was attacked and captured by Thanos\' Black Order, only for him to then be rescued by Iron Man and Spider-Man. Having also been joined by the Guardians of the Galaxy, Strange battled against Thanos. However, as Strange had seen into the future and knew his only path to victory, he had willingly handed over the Time Stone, allowing Thanos to enact the Snap, killing Strange and trillions of other lives. However, Strange and all the rest of Thanos\' victims had been resurrected five years later by the Avengers, and battled against an alternate Thanos, which resulted with Iron Man sacrificing his life to save the universe.\r\n\r\nStrange offered his aid to Spider-Man, whose identity of Peter Parker was unmasked by Mysterio, as he asked Strange to make the world forget this. However, due to Parker\'s interference, the spell soon went wrong, and Strange inadvertently unleashed enemies of Spider-Man from across the Multiverse. Capturing these enemies, Strange tried to use the Macchina di Kadavus to send them to their universes to meet their inevitable fates, which Spider-Man had refused to allow, hoping to give these people a chance at redemption. Having been trapped in the Mirror Dimension, Strange then returned and fought to contain the Multiversal rift. With no other choice, Strange cast a spell to return the visitors back to their universes and close the rifts, but also at the cost of making everyone, including himself, forget Parker\'s existence.\r\n\r\nBeing heralded of new interdimensional threats, Strange came across America Chavez, a teenager with the ability to travel through the Multiverse. While investigating these threats, Strange learned that Wanda Maximoff, who fell corrupted to the Darkhold, was responsible. As Kamar-Taj fell under attack by her, Chavez sent Strange spiraling through the multiverse, where they were eventually arrested by the Illuminati. With the help of a Palmer-counterpart, Strange and Chavez located the Darkhold\'s antithetical, the Book of Vishanti, only for Maximoff to destroy it and abduct Chavez, banishing Strange and Palmer to an incursioned universe. Confronting that reality\'s Doctor Strange, Strange claimed the Darkhold to utilize dreamwalking in order to rescue Chavez. Helping her gain full control of her powers, the two swayed Maximoff from the Darkhold\'s influence, before her apparent self-sacrifice to destroy all copies of the Darkhold throughout the Multiverse. In the aftermath, Strange was confronted by a sorceress who enlisted his help in fixing a new incursion.',

During the Kree-Skrull War, Vers was captured by Skrulls, resulting in her returning to Earth and beginning to recall her past, with help from Nick Fury and Maria Rambeau. Vers subsequently discovered that Yon-Rogg and the Kree Empire had been manipulating her for years, learning from Talos that the Skrulls were merely seeking to find a new home. With this information, Danvers, rejecting her Vers persona, unlocked her true powers and defeated the Kree invasion onto Earth that was being led by Ronan the Accuser, before setting off out to the far reaches of the galaxy to finish what her late mentor Mar-Vell had previously started, honouring her by becoming known as Captain Marvel.\r\n\r\nSpending twenty-three years journeying through the universe, Captain Marvel learned of the Snap through the distress call sent out by Fury and had joined the Avengers in an attempt to confront Thanos and reverse the damage done, managing to also rescue Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space along the way.

At this time, Wilson met Steve Rogers and was drawn to his conflict with HYDRA, as Rogers needed help from anyone not associated with S.H.I.E.L.D. since they had been infiltrated by HYDRA. Retaking his old wings, Wilson had then assisted with destroying all of Alexander Pierce\'s schemes of world domination. Following their victory against Pierce\'s HYDRA units, Falcon then agreed to assist Rogers in tracking down the Winter Soldier, who was in fact Rogers\' close friend who had been brainwashed by HYDRA.\r\n\r\nAs Falcon continued searching for the Winter Soldier, he was recruited into the Avengers, since their original team disbanded following the defeat of Ultron.

However, as the Winter Soldier was blamed for terrorist attacks by Helmut Zemo, Falcon stood by Captain America with protecting the Winter Soldier, which had then caused the Avengers Civil War. In the wake of this clash, Falcon, and several other Avengers who were loyal to Captain America, were defeated by Iron Man, and locked into the Raft, until Captain America freed them as they became fugitives.\r\n\r\nWhile the Avengers were still disbanded, Earth had come under attack by Thanos and his Black Order, bringing Falcon and his allies out of hiding.

When Thor was to be crowned King, Loki had sabotaged the coronation by letting the Frost Giants attack Asgard, thus leading Thor to seek vengeance on Jotunheim, which resulted in Thor\'s banishment to Earth and Loki finding out the truth about his heritage. Frigga gave Loki the throne when Odin had fallen into the Odinsleep; however, when the Warriors Three and Sif attempted to return Thor home, Loki was forced to try to stop them. Regardless, Thor returned from his exile on Earth and ended Loki\'s reign, thwarting his attempt to declare war on the Nine Realms with Jotunheim\'s destruction.

Having been dead for five years, Spider-Man was resurrected in the Blip, and rejoined their fight against Thanos, ultimately watching Stark sacrifice his life to defeat the Mad Titan.\r\n\r\nThe bereaved and traumatized Parker decided to take some time off his hero duties, seeking refuge on his trip to Europe with all his classmates. However, despite wanting to focus his attention on winning the attention of Michelle Jones, Parker witnessed Hydro-Man\'s attack in Venice and was recruited by Nick Fury to work with Mysterio to defeat the Elementals. Dubbed Night Monkey after defeating Molten Man in Prague, Parker bequeathed Stark\'s glasses to Mysterio, only to discover that Mysterio manipulated him in doing so to gain access to Stark\'s weaponized drones to stage more threats. Recruiting Happy Hogan\'s help, Spider-Man traveled to London and defeated Mysterio, who died of a misfired gunshot on the Tower Bridge.\r\n\r\nUpon Parker\'s return to New York, doctored footage was sent to The Daily Bugle incriminating him instead as the mastermind of the drone attacks as well as the murderer of Mysterio, while exposing his true identity to the world in the process. While he was able to escape legal action with defense attorney Matt Murdock, the resulting controversy that upended his and his friends\' futures led Parker to enlist Doctor Strange to cast a memory-wiping spell to make the identity of Spider-Man a secret once more. However, Parker\'s repeated amendments midcasting ruined the spell, resulting in a multiversal rift that unleashed foes of Spider-Man from alternate universes, including Doctor Octopus, Lizard, Electro, Sandman and Norman Osborn. Although intending to cure them before sending them back to avert their ill-fated deaths in their native universes, Osborn\'s Green Goblin alter convinced the villains to betray Parker, ultimately resulting in his aunt\'s death. Parker then met two alternate versions of himself who helped him overcome his grief and cure their enemies in the battle on the Statue of Liberty.\r\n\r\nFaced with an impossible choice, Parker had Strange cast another spell to make the entire world oblivious to his existence in order to protect the Multiverse, erasing the existence of Peter Parker from history itself. Starting anew, Parker resumed his duties undisturbed as an independent Spider-Man.',

        info: 'Wanda Maximoff is a native of Sokovia who grew up with her fraternal twin brother, Pietro. Born with the latent mythical ability to harness Chaos Magic, she developed a hatred against Tony Stark and rallied anti-American protests after the Novi Grad Bombings killed her parents. Years later, in an effort to help purge their country of strife, the twins joined HYDRA and agreed to undergo experiments with the Scepter under the supervision of Baron Strucker, with the Mind Stone awakening and amplifying Wanda\'s powers. While her brother developed super-speed, she attained various psionic abilities. When HYDRA fell, the twins joined Ultron to get their revenge on Stark but abandoned him when they discovered his true intentions to eradicate humanity. Wanda and Pietro joined the Avengers during the Battle of Sokovia to stop Ultron; Pietro was killed during the battle but Wanda survived and shortly after relocated to the Avengers Compound in the United States of America.\r\n\r\nDuring the Avengers Civil War, she sided with Captain America and was briefly imprisoned in the Raft before Rogers freed her alongside his teammates. Over the next two years, Maximoff reunited and reconciled with Vision, and together the two started living off the grid in Europe, forming a romantic relationship. In 2018, they were ambushed by the Black Order, who sought the Mind Stone, and rejoined the Avengers to seek refuge in Wakanda. Maximoff took part in the city\'s defence when the Black Order invaded the city, where she was forced to kill Vision to prevent Thanos from completing the Infinity Gauntlet. However, she witnessed Thanos resurrect and kill Vision before initiating the Snap, which claimed Maximoff\'s life. After the victims of the Snap were resurrected in 2023, Maximoff was among the many heroes who fought during the Battle of Earth, defeating Thanos and his armies.\r\n\r\nSoon after, Maximoff became overwhelmed by immense grief from her recent personal losses, unwittingly unleashing her Chaos Magic powers to enthrall the citizens of Westview into creating an alternate idyllic paradise of classical sitcom tropes. With a recreated Vision as her husband, Maximoff lived her ideal life, even producing twin sons, Tommy and Billy. Further complicating the crisis was Agatha Harkness, a fellow witch who sought to understand the nature of Maximoff\'s new reality, and a S.W.O.R.D. operation led by Tyler Hayward who wished to eliminate her. Maximoff, now knowing her own identity as the fabled Scarlet Witch, defeated Harkness and the S.W.O.R.D. agents, and dispelled her reality, erasing her family in the process. Realizing the amount of damage she had done to Westview, Maximoff fled into isolation and began studying the Darkhold.\r\n\r\nOnce she learned about the Multiverse, Maximoff believed that the only way for her to see her children again was to find them in a different universe. In her brutal quest to steal the powers of multiversal travel from a teenager called America Chavez, Maximoff came at odds with her former ally Doctor Strange, and enacted a merciless attack on the Masters of the Mystic Arts, as well as a group of superpowered individuals from a different universe known as the Illuminati, the latter through an alternate Wanda Maximoff. Finally, after realizing that her violent rampage had in fact turned her into a monster at the precipice of her victory by being rejected by Tommy and Billy from another universe, Maximoff redeemed herself by destroying every version of the Darkhold within the Multiverse once and for all, demolishing the Darkhold Castle atop Wundagore Mountain in the process, and seemingly taking her own life.',

However, as it was discovered that the Orb being sought by Ronan the Accuser was one of the Infinity Stones, Rocket was convinced to risk everything to stop Ronan\'s plans to destroy Xandar. During the ensuing conflict, Rocket managed to assist his friends in destroying Ronan, despite Groot being killed. Rocket then became a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy alongside the newly planted baby Groot.\r\n\r\nRocket continued working with the Guardians when they were hired by the Sovereign to slay the Abilisk. However, Rocket took the job as a way to steal Anulax Batteries with the intention to later sell them. This angered Ayesha, causing her to declare war on the Guardians and hire the Ravagers to capture them. Rocket and Groot were soon captured by Taserface under Yondu Udonta\'s command, forcing Rocket and Udonta to work together in order to break free and kill Taserface. During his time with Udonta, Rocket learned how to better himself and wishing to save his Guardians family, joined Udonta during the Battle on Ego\'s Planet.\r\n\r\nFour years later, the Guardians rescued Thor after the Asgardians were slaughtered by Thanos, who had resumed his quest for the Infinity Stones himself. The Guardians split up; while the rest of the team returned to Knowhere to find the Reality Stone, Rocket and Groot accompanied Thor to Nidavellir to obtain the weapon Stormbreaker. Using the Bifrost Bridge, the trio traveled to Earth to join the Battle of Wakanda, where he fought alongside Winter Soldier. Their efforts to stop Thanos were unsuccessful, and Rocket was one of the only Guardians to survive Thanos\' subsequent mass slaughter, along with Nebula.

        info: 'Colonel James Rupert Rhodey Rhodes is an officer with the United States Air Force and liaison between the military in the Department of Acquisitions and Stark Industries, where he became close friends with Tony Stark. When Stark had been kidnapped by the Ten Rings, Rhodes personally led a mission to rescue his best friend. However, upon their return, Rhodes saw Stark moving away from developing his weapons for the military and soon discovered that he was instead focusing on becoming a hero known as Iron Man. Despite all of his fears for his friend\'s safety, Rhodes still joined Iron Man in bringing down Obadiah Stane\'s schemes, while trying to keep Stark\'s secrets, only for Stark to reveal them to the media himself.\r\n\r\nWith Iron Man\'s identity known, Rhodes found himself under pressure from the United States Congress and the military to take possession of the armor for himself, something that he was against. However, as Stark\'s reckless behavior got even worse, Rhodes had no choice but to take the Mark II before handing it over to the military, with Justin Hammer upgrading it with his new weapons to rebrand Rhodes as War Machine. However, just when War Machine was being presented to the world, Ivan Vanko returned and attacked the Stark Expo with an army of Hammer Drones, as War Machine teamed up with Iron Man to bring him down, resulting in Rhodes keeping the armor for himself, despite Stark\'s continued objections.\r\n\r\nIn response to the Chitauri Invasion, Rhodes took on the identity of the Iron Patriot and worked directly for President Matthew Ellis. When a terrorist named the Mandarin was claiming responsibility for a string of domestic terrorist attacks, Rhodes was dispatched to hunt him down. However, Rhodes had soon discovered that the Mandarin was in fact a ruse created by Aldrich Killian by hiring actor Trevor Slattery to portray the role, as Killian managed to capture Rhodes and steal the Iron Patriot Armor, as Killian\'s henchman, Eric Savin, then used it to kidnap President Ellis as part of his ongoing Mandarin ruse. Rhodes managed to free himself and teamed up with Stark to defeat Killian\'s army of Extremis Soldiers and save President Ellis before Killian could publicly execute him, as Rhodes also uncovered Vice President Rodriguez\'s role in Killian\'s plan.\r\n\r\nReverting back to the War Machine name, Rhodes continued serving his country and assisted the Avengers in the Battle of Sokovia, playing a key role in ensuring that as many Sokovians were evacuated before Ultron could cause mass extinction. Following the battle, Rhodes became an official member of the Avengers. However, Rhodes soon found himself in conflict with the team as the debate over the Sokovia Accords led to Captain America and Iron Man disagreeing and War Machine choosing to side with the government in support of the Accords. As the conflict worsened, War Machine clashed with Captain America\'s allies while they tried to protect the Winter Soldier and expose the plans of Helmut Zemo, only for War Machine to be disabled as he had been inadvertently shot out of the sky by Vision.\r\n\r\nHaving been given leg braces by Tony Stark to help him walk again, Rhodes had became disillusioned by the government and decided to disobey Thaddeus Ross\' orders and instead assisted Steve Rogers as they had learned of the impending invasion of the Mad Titan, Thanos and his Black Order. Once they traveled to Wakanda in order to protect the Mind Stone from Thanos, War Machine fought alongside his allies in their attempts to hold back the Black Order and their own army of Outriders. However, as Thanos arrived himself, War Machine and the others were unable to defeat him as Thanos took the Mind Stone and caused the Snap, as War Machine had then watched on helplessly while trillions of lives were erased.\r\n\r\nDetermined to undo Thanos\' actions, War Machine joined the Avengers to the Garden, as they discovered that Thanos had destroyed the Infinity Stones, prompting Thor to behead the Mad Titan. However, by 2023, the Avengers learned to travel through time and initiated a Time Heist, where War Machine joined Nebula on a mission to obtain the Power Stone from Morag in 2014. Succeeding in the mission, the Avengers resurrected the victims of the Snap, before then being attacked by an alternate Thanos and his entire armies of the Chitauri and Outriders.

Originally conceived as the perfect form for Ultron, the body was taken by the Avengers before Tony Stark and Bruce Banner proceeded to upload the remnants of Stark\'s personal A.I. J.A.R.V.I.S. into it. Upon his birth, Vision declared he was neither Ultron nor J.A.R.V.I.S., but one that would fight with them to protect humanity. Vision had then joined with the Avengers in the Battle of Sokovia, using his powers to prevent Ultron from transferring his consciousness to the internet, and allowing the Avengers to successfully put an end to his plan.\r\n\r\nIn the wake of the Ultron Offensive, Vision became an official member of the Avengers under Captain America\'s leadership. However, tension between these Avengers rose following the creation of the Sokovia Accords, as Vision saw the equations regarding the number of threats related to their actions as the reason for them to allow oversight of their actions.

However, Vision was soon attacked by the Black Order, who were attempting to steal the Mind Stone from his head under the orders from Thanos. Having been rescued by his allies, Vision agreed to have the Mind Stone removed from his head and destroyed, as they traveled to Wakanda to enlist the help of Shuri. Their attempts were unsuccessful, as the Black Order attacked Wakanda, while Corvus Glaive was able to force the wounded Vision into the open.

To complete this goal, Thanos set about hunting down all the Infinity Stones, being confident that the combined force of the Stones would grant him sufficient power. Thanos forged alliances with Loki and Ronan the Accuser in order to track down some of the Stones. However, both alliances cost Thanos much of his resources, including the Mind Stone and the loyalty of his daughters, Gamora and Nebula. Fed up with all his subordinates\' ongoing failures, Thanos made the decision to seek and procur the Stones himself, and he began by forcing Eitri to create the Infinity Gauntlet for him so that he would be able to wield the power of the Stones safely.\r\n\r\nThanos then engaged in a ferocious crusade in order to obtain the Infinity Stones. During his mission, both Thanos and his Black Order invaded multiple planets and slaughtered thousands to gain the stones, including Loki and the Asgardians.

Thanos soon found himself challenged by the alliances of the entire universe\'s greatest heroes, which included the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy. However, despite facing off against the powerfully combined opposition and the wrath of Thor, Thanos still ultimately triumphed as he completed the Infinity Gauntlet, using it to finally complete his goal through the Snap, which resulted in half of all life in the universe being wiped out with a mere snap of his fingers.

Barnes, along with whoever still remained from his regiment, was later rescued by Rogers, who had become Captain America during Barnes\' absence. Upon joining forces with the continuing war, Barnes and Rogers formed their Howling Commandos, to battle Red Skull\'s forces. However, during the attempt to finally capture Zola out in the Austrian Alps, Barnes was caught up in the ambush and plummeted hundreds of feet from a train. As no body was ever recovered, Barnes had then been presumed deceased, becoming honored as a hero.\r\n\r\nUnbeknownst to his team, Barnes\' enhanced abilities allowed him to survive the fall, albeit with the loss of his left arm. Once he was found by the Soviet Union, as well as HYDRA, Barnes had subsequently been brainwashed and armed with a new cybernetic limb in order to then become their operative, known as the Winter Soldier.

In 2014, the Winter Soldier had been ordered by Alexander Pierce to kill Nick Fury, in order to ensure that all Pierce\'s schemes with Project Insight could go ahead. However, the Winter Soldier was challenged by Steve Rogers, which had eventually triggered him to begin remembering his prior life.\r\n\r\nIn the wake of their Battle at the Triskelion, Barnes, now free from his brainwashing, deserted HYDRA in order to remember his past and end his long, violent history. Two years later, Barnes was then framed for the Bombing of the Vienna International Centre, which claimed the life of T\'Chaka, among many other innocent lives. As Black Panther then sought his revenge for his father\'s death, Barnes had been repeatedly saved by Captain America, which sparked the Avengers Civil War as a team of Avengers led by Iron Man was sent to capture him.
