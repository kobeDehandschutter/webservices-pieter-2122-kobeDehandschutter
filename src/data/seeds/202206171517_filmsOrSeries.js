        summary: 'Tony Stark eventually inherits his father’s company. Over the years, Stark Industries has been manufacturing and supplying weapons across the world. Obadiah Stane, a senior personnel in the company, has been illegally trafficking weapons. In one of Tony’s demonstrations of the Jerico missile, he’s captured by terrorists. In the process, Tony is wounded in the chest by shrapnel shards from the explosion. In the cave, where Tony is kept, is another captive, Dr. Yinsen, who implants an electromagnet into Tony’s chest to keep the shards out of his heart. The terrorists demand that Tony builds them missiles, but Tony and Yinsen build an armored suit powered by an arc reactor. Yinsen sacrifices himself and Tony blows his way out destroying the terrorist camp. Tony gets found by his friend Colonel James Rhodes and begins work on a more advanced suit powered by a more powerful arc reactor. He also announces that Stark Industries will stop manufacturing weapons which annoys Stane. Tony finds out about Stane and flies off to Afghanistan to blow up the bad guys who have his guns. We’re introduced to Tony’s secretary, Pepper Potts, who hacks into the company’s database to locate all illegal shipments. She also informs S.H.I.E.L.D’s agent Phil Coulson about Stane’s activities. Stane reverse engineers a new suite for himself and steals Tony’s arc leaving him to die. Tony manages to get to his old arc reactor. We then have a final showdown between Tony (who’s now the Iron Man) and Stane. Tony has Pepper overload the giant arc reactor powering his building which causes a surge that consumes Stane. The next day, Tony announces to the world that he is the Iron Man.\r\n\r\n',

        summary: 'While not shown in this film, Dr. Bruce Banner is subject to gamma radiations in an experiment gone wrong. As a result, when Bruce is angry, he transforms into the Hulk. In this film, Bruce is lying low in Brazil, working in a bottling plant. But due to a small cut on his hands, his blood happens to get into one of the bottles. This bottle eventually causes a death by gamma poisoning and is traced back to Bruce. General Ross and Emil Blonsky want to weaponize the Hulk and hence try to capture Bruce. But they lose to the Hulk. Blonsky is initially given a small dose of the low-power super-soldier serum, this makes him stronger and gives him healing powers, but he begins losing his mind. After multiple defeats at the hands of the hulk, Blonsky finally gets Banner’s blood injected into him. The combination of the super-soldier serum and the infected gamma blood transforms Blonsky into a mindless beast – Abomination. The Hulk battles the Abomination and kills him. After this, Bruce stays in British Columbia and slowly learns to turn into the Hulk in a controlled manner.\r\n',

        summary: 'While the arc reactor, that Tony made, powers his suit, it’s not his invention. Many years back his father, Howard, and a Russian scientist, Anton Vanko, invented it. Anton tried to sell it for profit and is deported back home. Ivan, Anton’s son, happens to see the Iron Man powered by his father arc and wants revenge. Ivan begins building a mini arc reactor based weapon. At a Grand Prix, Ivan attacks Tony who uses his portable suit to become Iron Man and defeats Ivan. Seeing this event, Justin Hammer, a Start Industry rival, stages Ivan’s death and gets him to build armored suits.\r\n Tony’s arc reactor uses a Palladium core, and this is slowly poisoning him and will kill him soon. As a result, Tony makes Pepper the CEO of his company and gets a new assistant, Natasha. This is Agent Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow), undercover, who is assessing Tony. Nick Fury meets Tony and says that he knew Howard Stark back in the day and hands Tony some of Howard’s old material. In the 3-D hologram, Tony discovers a piece of hidden information for a new element – it’s fair to assume that Howard Stark found this by experimenting with the Tesseract that hosts the Space Stone. Tony synthesizes this element with the help of his computer J.A.R.V.I.S. This new element removes the need for Palladium. Meanwhile, Ivan takes remote control of all of Justin’s drones and wreaks havoc. Rhodes and Iron Man fight them off and defeat Ivan, who detonates the drones and himself.\r\n \r\n \r\n',

For rupturing the truce between Asgard and Jotunheim, Odin exiles Thor to Earth after stripping him off all the Godly powers. Thor’s hammer, the source of his power, is enchanted such that only the worthy can wield it. Thor gets separated from his hammer. While the hammer is found by S.H.I.E.L.D, Thor is found by Dr. Jane Foster and Dr. Erik Selvig. Thor manages to get to the hammer but is unable to lift it because he’s not worthy. Back in Asgard, Loki finds out that he’s adopted. While Odin enters his deep slumber, Loki takes over the throne. Thor’s friends don’t like this and convince the gatekeeper of the Bifröst (rainbow bridge transportation thingy), Heimdall, to send them to Earth. Loki gets to know of this and sends the Destroyer (an indestructible metallic being thingy) to Earth to kill Thor.\r\n\r\nThe Destroyer defeats Thor’s friends, but he offers himself as a sacrifice and is struck. Because of his worthy actions, Thor’s hammer returns to him. Thor destroys the Destroyer and heads back to Asgard to confront Loki.

        summary: 'In this film, we are shown that a meteorite hit a place in Africa thousands of years ago. This meteorite contained the metal Vibranium (the one Cap’s shield is made from). One warrior eats a heart-shaped herb affected by the metal and gains super-human strength. Thus is formed the kingdom of Wakanda under the leadership of this warrior. Over generations, they use the Vibranium to become highly advanced but remain hidden as a 3rd world nation.\r\n\r\nWhen T’Challa is a young boy, his uncle begins dealing with Ulysses Klaue and supplying him Vibranium; now we know how Klaue provided Ultron with the metal. The uncle wants to empower all the people from Africa across the world with weapons to rise against their oppressors. T’Challa’s father kills his brother and abandons his brother’s child, Erik, to grow up as an orphan. Erik (Killmonger) learns about the real Wakanda from his father’s journals and eventually joins the black-ops. He knows one day he’ll get a shot at the throne and prepares for it.\r\n\r\nAfter the events of Civil War, T’Challa returns to Wakanda to become king. He faces M’Baku in ritualistic combat to the death and defeats him but doesn’t kill him. Erik initially appears to be working with Klaue. A CIA agent, Everett, gets involved and is severely wounded while trying to arrest Klaue. T’Challa decides to take Everett back to Wakanda to save his life. Erik kills Klaue, shows up in Wakanda, and announces who he is. He challenges T’Challa and defeats him, throws him over a waterfall, and becomes king. He also consumes the herb to turn super-powered. Erik picks up where his father left off and commissions jets to fly out Vibranium to dealers in America. T’Challa is saved by M’Baku as a repayment. T’Challa’s family revive him by giving him the last of the heart-shaped-herb. We have a final showdown between the Black Panther and Erik where Erik is killed. CIA agent, Everett, remote pilots a jet and takes down the planes carrying the Vibranium. After this, T’Challa announces at the UN the truth about Wakanda.\r\n',

        summary: 'Thanos is a mighty Titan who has a simple solution to over-population – randomly kill off half the universe so the survivors will have a better chance of .. well, surviving. For this, he needs to collect all six infinity stones, put it on his infinity gauntlet, and snap his fingers.\r\n\r\nBefore the film begins, Thanos has already gotten the Power Stone from the Nova Corps in Xandar. He beats up Thor, Hulk and kills Loki and takes out the Space Stone from Tesseract. Heimdal, the keeper of the Bifröst, teleports Hulk to Earth before getting killed. Hulk transforms back to Bruce and is unable to go back to being Hulk. Bruce runs into and warns Dr. Strange who contacts Tony.\r\n\r\nThanos’ henchmen land up on Earth to get the Time Stone. The battle leads to Dr. Strange, Iron-Man and Spider-Man to get on the henchmen’s Space Ship. Bruce contacts Captain America. Wanda and Vision are attacked by another set of henchmen. Cap, Natasha, and Falcon come to their aid. They head to Wakanda to figure a way to separate the Mind Stone from Vision’s head.\r\n\r\nThe Guardians rescue Thor who tells them that Thanos will head to Knowhere to get the Reality Stone from the Collector. Groot, Rocket and Thor head to Nidavellir to get a new Axe forged from a giant dwarf.\r\n\r\nQuill, Drax, Gamora and Mantis head to Knowhere only to realize that Thanos has already taken the Reality Stone. He also kidnaps Gamora and he has already captured Nebula. To save Nebula from torture, Gamora reveals the location of the Soul Stone. Thanos and Gamora head to Vormir, where the Soul Stone is, and meet with Red Skull (remember the guy who got sucked in through a wormhole in Captain America?). The Soul Stone needs a sacrifice, and Thanos kills Gamora to procure it.\r\n\r\nNebula escapes and teams with the remaining Guardians and heads to Titan. Here, Nebula, Mantis, Drax, Spider-Man, Iron-Man, and Dr.Strange try to get Thano’s gauntlet off. But Quill interferes after learning that Gamora is dead. As a result, Thanos defeats everyone and Dr. Strange hands over the Time Stone in exchange for Iron-Man’s life.\r\n\r\nAt Wakanda, Black Panther and friends, Bucky, Captain America, Rhodes, Natasha, Bruce, Falcon, and Wanda fight off Thanos’ henchmen. Shuri tries to separate the Mind Stone from Vision but is unable to. Groot, Rocket, and Thor (with his new Axe) arrive at Wakanda to help. Thanos finally arrives and beats everyone up. Wanda destroys the Mind Stone and kills Vision. But Thanos uses the Time Stone to reverse time and rips the Mind Stone out of Vision. Thor comes landing his Axe into Thanos’ chest, but Thanos snaps his gauntleted fingers. As promised, half the population of the universe is instantly killed.\r\n\r\nOn Titan, Iron-Man and Nebula are left alive while Quill, Drax, Mantis, Spider-Man and Dr. Strange die. And in Wakanda, Bruce, Rhodes, Rocket, Cap, Natasha, Thor, and a few Wakandans remain alive while Blank Panther, Bucky, Groot, Wanda, and Falcon die.\r\n',

        summary: 'Years after Captain America’s plane crash, Howard continues to test on the Tesseract to learn more about it. Eventually, Project Pegasus is created by S.H.I.E.L.D to deal solely with studying the Tesseract. Over time, a Kree by the name of Mar-Vell somehow infiltrates S.H.I.E.L.D under the name of Dr. Wendy Lawson. She becomes the head of Project Pegasus and relocates the Tesseract to her secret lab in space. She continues to work as part of Project Pegasus to create a Light-Speed Engine. Though she is a Kree she doesn’t approve of her people obliterating the Skrulls (a race of shape-shifters). She wants to hand the Skrulls the Light-Speed Engine so they can escape. She’s also secretly stowed away a bunch of Skrulls in her Space Lab. Before she can complete her work, a Kree squadron, lead by Yon-Rogg, finds her in 1989.\r\n\r\nMar-Vell has asked a young pilot, Carol Danvers, to accompany her and the two of them get shot down. This plane has a Jet Engine that Mar-Vell has built, and this is powered by the Tesseract (which is still safe in space). Yon-Rogg kills Mar-Vell. Carol shoots and blows up the jet engine. Somehow, she ends up absorbing all the energy from the explosion. Given the closest thing to the Light-Speed Engine has been blown up, Yon-Rogg takes Carol with him as she might be the key to figuring out the Engine. The Kree use Carol’s amnesia to make her believe she is a Kree too. To keep her powers at bay, they put an inhibitor on her. Six years pass.\r\n\r\nIn one of the missions in 1995, Carol is captured by the Skrulls who are trying to get to the location of the Secret Lab. Long story short, Carol ends up on Earth, runs into a young Nick Fury, finds the lab, remembers her Earth life, realizes the Skrulls are good, gets the Tesseract (which is gobbled by an alien cat), removes her inhibitor, unleashes her full powers, takes down all of the Kree, and set the Skrulls free. The exotic cat scratches Nick Fury’s eye causing him to lose it, and he gets his famous eye patch. Carol gives Nick Fury a pager-on-steroids which he is to use to call out to her only in case of a vital emergency.\r\n',

While it was just a few seconds for him, 5 years pass for the rest.

Using drones and carefully projected holograms, Beck takes on the role of Mysterio, a super-human from a parallel universe, fighting enemies called the Elementals. \r\n\r\nFirst, Beck stages a fight in Mexico with the Earth Elemental. Nick Fury and Maria Hill take notice and reach out to Beck. Next, he stages a battle with the Water Elemental in Italy. Peter, who happens to be part of a school trip, witnesses this fight and helps protect his classmates.\r\n\r\nFury hands Peter Tony’s glasses powered by the AI, EDITH, which gives him access to Stark’s orbital weapon supply. When Peter and Beck meet, Beck feeds him lies about a multiverse (getting the audience excited about how this movie could connect with Spiderman: Into The Spiderverse). \r\n\r\nAvoiding his superhero duties, Peter hands Tony’s glasses to Beck and transfers control. Beck uses the orbital weapon to wreak havoc with the more elaborate holograms. MJ discloses that she knows Peter is Spider-Man, and the two stumble upon a drone of Beck’s that makes them realize that Beck was bluffing. In a final fight, Peter takes down Beck.

        summary: 'WandaVision follows Wanda Maximoff through the implications of her undealt grief and pain caused by many different events that unfolded in previous movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. To name a few: her twin brother Pietro died when using his super-speed to save others; she was responsible for a bombing that killed the King of Wakanda; and lastly, she had to kill her love, the Vision, who was an android in order to save the rest of the world.  When paired with her telekinesis, psychokinesis, and energy manipulation abilities, her depression manifests itself as a sitcom that causes a whole town to be under her control. Westview citizens were forced to live their lives as characters, a part of Wanda’s alternate reality. The town of Westview, New Jersey, is now home to Wanda and Vision, who she essentially rematerialized using her powers fueled by her grief.  Throughout the show, we see many references to the comics: Wanda and Vision’s kids and a powerful witch, Agatha, showing herself as the real villain in this narrative.

        summary: 'The events of the story happen 6 months after half the population of the world returned from the Blip (Thanos’ Snap). Sam Wilson now works for the U.S. army stopping aerial atrocities. He chooses to remain “The Falcon” and thereby gives away Steve Roger’s shield to an American Museum, thus, denying to continue the legacy. On the other hand, Steve’s childhood friend and war companion, Bucky Barnes aka “The Winter Soldier” is suffering from PTSD and therefore taking government-mandated therapy. He pleads that he was brainwashed for all killings he did as the winter soldier and thereby has been granted a pardon.  While the two are struggling with their private lives, the world witnesses a new terrorist group, the Flag Smashers, who are refugees living on the conflicted borderland waiting for countries to accept their existence. Pained by government inefficiency, the group takes measures into their hand. They wish to put up a demonstration so that the whole world would recognize their plea and for that matter of fact, these people inject themselves with super-soldier serum thus turning themselves into an army of super-terrorists.  In order to stop these terrorists, the Government assigns a new Captain America, John Walker, as the symbol of peace. Their stance completely destroys Sam’s sacrifice, and it enrages Bucky Barnes who fails to see Captain America in John Walker. Though the duo tries to find out the mystery behind the super-soldier serum that surfaced after so long. With the help of Avengers: Civil War Villain, Helmut Zemo, the duo reaches Madripoor, a criminal sanctuary city-island managed by a mysterious Power Broker. They attain the knowledge that Power Broker hired a former Hydra scientist Dr. Wilfred Nagel, to re-create the serum and sell it in the international market. The leader of the Flag Smashers group, Karli Morgenthau was both the buyer and consumer of this Super Soldier Serum. Karli had been coming for the remaining serum by Dr.Nagel but in a fight against Zemo, Falcon, and the Winter Soldier, Nagel loses his life. Later, Zemo faces the Flag Smashers group and destroys the remaining super-soldier serum, thereby spoiling Karli’s plan to form an army of Super Soldiers. However, John Walker gets his hand on one of the last vials and consumes it secretly. In the fight, Karli accidentally kills Walker’s friend and mate, Hoskins, which enrages Walker, thus turning him into a monster. To avenge his friend’s death, John kills one of the flag smashers in front of the whole world, putting a bloodstain on the shield forever.  With the remaining folks, Karli plans an attack on the GRC conference in New York City. Meanwhile, Sam and Bucky take away the shield from John and he is discharged of his services by a U.S. senator. With John gone, Sam is faced with the most important question of the entire series, is the world ready to accept a Black Captain America? Sam is in a dilemma but Bucky isn’t. He trusts Steve’s decision more than anything else in the world, and therefore while arresting and handing over Zemo to Dora Milaje, he requests a new Captain America attire for Sam Wilson.  In the last and the sixth episode, the world finally witnesses a Black Captain America upheld by Sam Wilson. The duo stops the flag smashers from threatening the voters of the GRC conference. Sam also makes a plea with the members of the GRC to reinstate their refugee policy so that another Karli Morgenthau doesn’t stand up urging for their rights and existence. We as individuals should try to make the world a better place and that is the only way to stop violence and terrorism.',

        summary: 'The show doesn’t seem that standalone at first. It opens with a scene from Avengers: Endgame when Loki (Tom Hiddleston) makes off with a powerful device known as the Tesseract. From here, the story diverges from what we’ve seen in the MCU. Loki is apprehended by the Time Variance Authority (TVA), which is sort of like a time-traveling FBI with one specific purpose: to protect the “sacred timeline.” From the TVA, Loki learns that he’s a variant, which is a fancy word for someone who deviates from the timeline set out by a mysterious trio called the Time Keepers, who control the flow of time and created the TVA in order to maintain its purity. Typically, variants are pruned, a nice way of saying they’re killed in order to protect that timeline from diverging from the plan. But the TVA has other ideas for Loki. Another variant has been terrorizing the TVA, appearing at multiple periods throughout time and space in order to kill their agents. This variant also happens to be another Loki — making our Loki the perfect man to track them down. It’s a lot to keep track of. There are parallel worlds and multiple timelines, not to mention the fact that this is a show starring the least-reliable narrator in the Marvel universe. The mystery of the TVA steadily grows over the course of the show; it seems like everyone knows either a lot less or a lot more than they’re letting on.',

        summary: 'In 5000 BC, ten superpowered Eternals — Ajak, Sersi, Ikaris, Kingo, Sprite, Phastos, Makkari, Druig, Gilgamesh, and Thena — are sent by the Celestial Arishem to Earth on their starship, the Domo, to exterminate the invasive Deviants. The last of the Deviants are killed in 1521, and the group\'s opinions differ over their continued responsibilities and their relationship with humankind. Over the next five hundred years, they mostly live apart from each other, awaiting Arishem\'s return.In the present day, Sersi and Sprite live together in London. After Sersi was left by her partner Ikaris centuries earlier, she is now in a relationship with human Dane Whitman, who works at the Natural History Museum. The trio is attacked by the Deviant Kro, with Ikaris arriving and chasing the creature away. Realizing the Deviants have returned, they travel to South Dakota to reunite with their leader, Ajak, only to find that she had been killed by Kro.Sersi is posthumously chosen by Ajak as her successor, granting her the ability to communicate with Arishem, who reveals that the mission of the Eternals was not to fight the Deviants but to prepare Earth for the \'Emergence\'. Arishem explains that for millions of years, the Celestials have been planting their seeds on populated planets for new Celestials to be born, with the Deviants sent by them to destroy the apex predators of each planet to ensure the development of intelligent life. However, when the Deviants evolved and began hunting the planets\' native populations, the Celestials created the Eternals to cull them. With the reversal of the Blip, Earth has reached the necessary population for the birth of the Celestial Tiamut, which will result in Earth\'s destruction.Having learned to love humanity, the Eternals reassemble and decide to prevent the Emergence. They reconvene with Kingo, Thena, and Gilgamesh before heading to Druig\'s residence in the Amazon rainforest, where they are attacked by Kro and the Deviants. The group successfully kill most of them, only for Kro to kill Gilgamesh before fleeing. After cremating him, they visit Phastos, who proposes for Druig to put Tiamut to sleep by amplifying his mind-control powers with the Uni-Mind, a connection between all the Eternals. The team also finds Makkari, who has been living in the Domo. Ikaris reveals he was informed of the Emergence by Ajak centuries before and, choosing to remain loyal to Arishem, fed Ajak to the Deviants six days prior to prevent her from stopping it, before planting her body back at her house to feign ignorance. Sprite joins Ikaris as he flees due to her unrequited love for him, while Kingo also leaves the group as he does not wish to face Arishem or fight his teammates.Makkari locates the place of the Emergence at the foot of an active volcano in the Indian Ocean, and the Eternals battle Ikaris and Sprite before being attacked by Kro, who is then killed by Thena. Druig knocks out Sprite after she attempts to kill Sersi, and the remaining Eternals work together to subdue Ikaris while Phastos activates the Uni-Mind. Ikaris breaks free of his restraints and approaches Sersi to kill her, but finds himself unable to do so due to his love for her. As both he and Sprite join the Uni-Mind, Sersi gains enough power to turn Tiamut to marble. Guilt-ridden, Ikaris flies into the Sun, while at Sprite\'s request, Sersi uses the remaining energy from the Uni-Mind to turn Sprite into a human, ending her permanent childlike state.Thena, Druig, and Makkari depart on the Domo to find other Eternals, while Sersi, Phastos, Kingo, and Sprite remain on Earth. Dane professes his love for Sersi and is about to reveal a secret about his family history when she, along with Phastos and Kingo, are remotely dragged into space by Arishem. Arishem states he is displeased with their treason, but elects to spare humanity if the Eternals\' memories show that humans are worthy of living. Vowing to return for judgment, he disappears into a singularity, taking the trio with him.'

Doctor Strange, who before this trailer was known to be one of the MCU’s brightest minds, somehow agrees with Peter’s plea and begins casting a spell. But when Peter says he’s concerned about the few who know his secret being in the dark again, he begins to have second thoughts. Those second thoughts distract Doctor Strange enough that the spell doesn’t cast as intended and boom: instant multiverse madness.',

        summary: 'We expect Thor: Love and Thunder to address the way we left the god of thunder at the end of Avengers: Endgame – that is, overweight, and teaming up with the Guardians of the Galaxy. This movie will be released before Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (due in 2023), so we expect that plot point to be touched upon here. Valkyrie was left as the ruler of New Asgard, a seaside village on Earth, so it\'ll be interesting to see how their stories link up again. Taika Waititi has indicated that the overweight Thor stuff had been done already, which perhaps explains why Hemsworth is in such godly shape in all the photos that have leaked from the set.Love and Thunder will be inspired by the Mighty Thor comics of star Marvel writer Jason Aaron. In that comic, Odinson loses the ability to lift Mjolnir, and Jane Foster takes on the mantle of Thor, while simultaneously battling cancer in her human hours.',
